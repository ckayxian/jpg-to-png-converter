# JPG to PNG Converter

## How it works
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
If you run JPGtoPNGconverter.py with two parameters, e.g. run `JPGtoPNGconverter.py pokemon/ new/`
the program is going to scan through the pokemon folder
and convert each pokemon jpg image into png and save them to new folder
You can use it to convert any JPG image to PNG
